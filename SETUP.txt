This is a very brief description of setting up Ruby on a Mac and executing the gc_app.  It is
really specific.

All the supporting libraries and tools were installed using Homebrew.  The full set of
instalation steps can be found in the first reference listed below.  Here are the 
quick command lines used:

<update to max OS 10.12 or later>
<install XCode from App store>
xcode-select --install
<install git>
<test if brew installed, if not do the floowing:>
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew install gpg
$ \curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable 
rvm get stable --autolibs=enable
source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm
rvm gemset list
rvm gemset use global
rvm gemset list
gem outdated
gem update
gem install nokogiri
gem install watir
<cd to your workspace directory>
git clone https://github.com/apiepho/gc_app.git
cd gc_app

At this point you can run gc_app.  There are alot of command line options.  I commonly use
the following:

time ruby gc_app.rb -c ./cache_files -e <email> -p <password>  -o xml -d gc.xml

   time - to see how long it takes
   -c   - set a directory for caching html pages (for susequent runs)
   -e   - GC login email
   -p   - GC login password (sorry, it will show in plain tet on the command line)
   -o   - output as xml
   -d   - destination file
   
This will produce a large xml file that is best viewed in a browser.  Most browsers will
let you expand and collapse the xml tags.
